* HackDepot Dockerfile
  A Dockerfile for [[https://docker.com/][Docker]] that aims to simplify [[https://github.com/cadrspace/hackdepot][HackDepot]] deployment.
  Note that the produced image will contain the version of the
  application from the =master= branch (which may be unstable.)

  The application consists of two images:
   - [[https://hub.docker.com/r/cadr/hackdepot/][cadr/hackdepot]]
   - [[https://hub.docker.com/r/cadr/32bit-debian-mongo/][cadr/32bit-debian-mongo]]
** Getting the sources
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ git clone https://github.com/cadrspace/hackdepot-docker.git
$ export REPO_ROOT=$(pwd)/hackdepot-docker
#+END_EXAMPLE
** Building
   This step is optional if you just want run HackDepot, because you
   can get the image from Docker Hub.  Nevertheless, rebuilding is
   required if you, for example, made some changes and want to test
   them.
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ cd $REPO_ROOT/hackdepot
$ docker build -t cadr/hackdepot .
#+END_EXAMPLE
** Running
   You can run the application using =docker-compose= command as
   follows:
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
$ cd $REPO_ROOT
$ docker-compose up
#+END_EXAMPLE

   When started, the application should be listening on the port 3000
   on the host.
